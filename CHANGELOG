IMPORTANT: Pipelines from 1.2.4 or older cannot be loaded from 1.2.5

New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/70
Word embeddings parameter for CRF NER annotator
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/78
Annotator features replace params and are now serialized using KRYO and partitioned files, increases performance and smaller
memory consumption in Driver for saving and loading pipelines with large corpora. Such features are now also broadcasted
for better performance in distributed environments. This enhancement is a breaking change, does not allow to load older pipelines

Bug fixes
----------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/cb9aa4366f3e2c9863482df39e07b7bacff13049
Stemmer was not capable of being deserialized (Implements DefaultParamsReadable)
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/75
Sentence Boundary detector was not properly setting bounds

1.2.4

---------------
New features
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/c17ddac7a5a9e775cddc18d672e80e60f0040e38
ResourceHelper now allows input files to be read in the shape of Spark Dataset, implicitly enabling HDFS paths, allowing larger annotator input files. Needs to set 'TXTDS' as input format Param to let annotators read this way. Allowed in: Lemmatizer, EntityExtractor, RegexMatcher, Sentiment Analysis models, Spell Checker and Dependency Parser.

---------------
Enhancements and progress
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/4920e5ce394b25937969cc4cab1d81172be722a3
CRF NER Benchmarking progress
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/pull/64
EntityExtractor refactored. This annotator uses an input file containing a list of entities to look for inside target text. This annotator has been refactored to be of better use and specifically faster, by using a Trie search algorithm. Proper examples included in python notebooks.

Bug fixes
---------------
* Issue https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/issues/41 <> https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/d3b9086e834233f3281621d7c82e32195479fc82
Fixed default resources not being loaded properly when using the library through --spark-packages. Improved input reading from resources and folder resources, and falling back to disk, with better error handling.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/08405858c6186e6c3e8b668233e30df12fa50374
Corrected param names in DocumentAssembler
* Issue https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/issues/58 <> https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/5a533952cdacf67970c5a8042340c8a4c9416b13
Deleted a left-over deprecated function which was misleading.
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/c02591bd683db3f615150d7b1d121ffe5d9e4535
Added a filtering to ensure no empty sentences arrive to unnormalized Vivekn Sentiment Analysis

Other
---------------
* https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp/commit/91d8acb1f0f4840dad86db3319d0b062bd63b8c6
Removed Regex NER due to slowness and little use. CRF NER to replace NER.

========
1.2.3
========
---------------
Bugfixes
---------------
* Sentence detection not properly bounding punctuation marks
* Sentence detection abbreviations feature disabled by default, since it is a slow feature and not necessary benefitial
* Sentence detection punctuation bounds improved algorithm performance by removing redundant formatting
* Fixed a bug causing sentiment analysis not to work when using normalized tokens that may cause tokens to be deleted from sentence
* Fixed Resource Helper text reading missing first line from text stream. More improvements to come later.
